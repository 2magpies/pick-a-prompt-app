## About

Pick-A-Prompt! provides an online version of drawing a writing prompt in an online setting.

### Problem Statement
Many writers' groups (48-Film Festival, 24-Hour Play Festival, WriteClub to name a few) have writer's draw prompts from a hat as a means to assign unique writing topics to each writer. 

As writers' groups are moving to remote digital forums, they need the ability to "draw" a writing prompt in an online setting.

### Stakeholders
Business Owners: Theatres, Writersâ€™ Groups  

Users: Playwrights


### Beta Customer

#### Requirements:
<li>Halloween theme</li>
<li>6 commissioned playwrights</li>

#### High-level Approach
