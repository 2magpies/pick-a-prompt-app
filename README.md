## About

Pick-A-Prompt provides an online version of the age-old tradition of drawing names from a hat. 

Many writers' groups (48-Film Festival, 24-Hour Play Festival, WriteClub to name a few) have writer's draw prompts from a hat as a means to assign unique topics to each writer. As writers' groups are moving to remote digital forums, Pick-A-Prompt will keep the tradition alive in an online setting.
